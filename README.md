## Description

A simple digital clock app that updates every second!

I learned a TON about JS through this project! This app was the first experience I’ve had with utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This taught me a lot about utilizing functions, values, parameters, methods, and gaining a better understanding about JavaScript as an object orientated and verbose language for functionality. Ran into a lot of concepts with JavaScript that I couldn’t grasp until I kept experimenting with multiple techniques and eventually catching on to the syntax and structure of the language. It was very exciting once I started to see the results of my work and finalizing the deliverables of the application.
